    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>a `query` is required.</code>
            <p>You must provide a query parameter. it could be anything, but have to be here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>`language` must be two characters, e.g. `EN`.</code>
            <p>The language parameter must be from the <a href="#">supported languages.</a>, otherwise nothing will show. However, if you provide a language parameter that include digits, the error will be raised.</p>
            <p><i>NOTE:</i> For most of the cases, you don't have to pass the language parameter, but good to know he will be there...</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Credits</h3>
            The api was build from respect and love to "FRIENDS" series.
            We build it because sentences and words from the series are often mentioned, and we want to find where they appeared.
            This project build by <a href="https://github.com/yeudaby">YeudaBy</a> and <a href="#">DavidLev.</a>
